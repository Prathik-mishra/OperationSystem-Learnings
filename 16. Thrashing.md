## 16. Thrashing

Thrashing refers to a situation in computer systems where the system spends a
significant amount of time and resources continuously swapping pages between
physical memory (RAM) and secondary storage (such as a hard disk) due to
excessive paging activity. In thrashing, the system is busy moving pages in and
out of memory rather than executing useful work, leading to severe degradation
in performance.
