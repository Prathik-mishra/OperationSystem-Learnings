## 11. Memory Management

Fixed partitioning and dynamic partitioning are two approaches used in memory
management systems to allocate and manage memory resources. 

Let's discuss
each approach:

### 1. Fixed Partitioning:
In fixed partitioning, memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions or blocks,
and each partition is assigned to a specific process or task. The system
allocates a predetermined amount of memory to each partition, which
remains fixed throughout the execution.
Fixed partitioning is relatively simple to implement and provides fast memory
allocation. However, it can lead to inefficient memory utilization due to
internal fragmentation, especially when processes have varying memory
requirements.

### 2. Dynamic Partitioning:
Dynamic partitioning, also known as variable partitioning, addresses the
limitation of fixed partitioning by allowing memory to be allocated and
deallocated dynamically based on the size requirements of processes.
Dynamic partitioning provides better memory utilization compared to fixed
partitioning, as memory can be allocated based on actual requirements.
However, managing fragmentation and efficiently allocating and deallocating
memory can be more complex.

Memory management techniques, such as compaction or memory allocation
algorithms like first-fit, best-fit, or worst-fit, are employed to optimize
memory utilization and minimize fragmentation in dynamic partitioning
systems.
