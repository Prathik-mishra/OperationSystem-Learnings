## 19. Disk scheduling algorithms
Disk scheduling is a key component of disk management that determines the
order in which disk I/O (input/output) requests are processed and serviced by the
disk controller. It aims to minimize the seek time and rotational latency and
maximize the overall disk performance.

### 1. FCFS (First-Come, First-Served): 
This is the simplest disk scheduling
algorithm that processes requests in the order they arrive. It does notconsider the position of the disk head or the proximity of the requests,
resulting in potential delays if there are long seek times between requests.

### 2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First): 
This algorithm selects the request with
the shortest seek time from the current position of the disk head. It minimizes
the average seek time and reduces the overall disk access time. However, it
may lead to starvation of requests located farther away from the current
position.

### 3. SCAN: 
Also known as the elevator algorithm, SCAN moves the disk head in
one direction (e.g., from the outermost track to the innermost or vice versa)
and services requests along the way. Once it reaches the end, it changes
direction and continues the same process. This algorithm provides a fair
distribution of service and prevents starvation, but it may result in longer
response times for requests at the far ends of the disk.

### 4. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN): 
Similar to SCAN, C-SCAN moves the disk head
in one direction, but instead of reversing direction, it jumps to the other end of
the disk and starts again. This ensures a more consistent response time for
all requests, but it may cause delays for requests that arrive after the head
has passed their location.

### 5. LOOK: 
LOOK is a variant of SCAN that only goes as far as the last request
in its current direction. Once there are no more requests in that direction, it
reverses direction. This reduces unnecessary traversal of the entire disk and
improves response times for requests.
### 6. C-LOOK (Circular LOOK): 
Similar to C-SCAN, C-LOOK jumps to the other
end of the disk without servicing requests along the way. This reduces seek
time and improves disk throughput.
