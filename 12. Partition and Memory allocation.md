## 12. Partition and Memory allocation

### 1. First Fit: 
The first-fit algorithm allocates the first available memory block that
is large enough to accommodate the process. It starts searching from the
beginning of the memory and selects the first suitable block encountered.
This algorithm is simple and provides fast allocation, but it may result in
relatively larger leftover fragments.

### 2. Best Fit: 
The best-fit algorithm searches for the smallest available memory
block that is large enough to accommodate the process. It aims to minimize
leftover fragments by choosing the most optimal block. This algorithm can
lead to better overall memory utilization, but it may involve more timeconsuming searches.

### 3. Worst Fit: 
The worst-fit algorithm allocates the largest available memory
block to the process. This approach intentionally keeps larger fragments to
accommodate potential future larger processes. While it may seem
counterintuitive, it can help reduce fragmentation caused by small processes
and improve overall memory utilization.
