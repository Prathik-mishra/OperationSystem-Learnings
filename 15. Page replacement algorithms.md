## 15. Page replacement algorithms

### 1. First-In-First-Out Page Replacement Algorithm
In FIFO page replacement, the operating system maintains a queue or list of
pages in the order they were brought into memory. When a page fault
happens (i.e., the required page is not in memory), the page at the front of
the queue, which was the earliest one to be brought in, is selected for
replacement. The new page is then brought into memory, and the page at the
front of the queue is removed.

### 2. Optimal Page replacement
In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest
duration of time in the future.
In theory, optimal page replacement provides the best possible performance
by minimizing the number of page faults. However, in practice, it is not
feasible to implement the optimal page replacement algorithm in most realworld scenarios. The main reason for this is that the algorithm requires
knowledge of future page references, which is generally impossible to
determine in advance.

### 3. Least Recently Used
In this algorithm, the page will be replaced which is least recently used.
LRU works on the principle that pages that have been recently accessed are
more likely to be accessed again in the near future. By replacing the least
recently used pages, it aims to retain the frequently accessed pages in
memory, reducing the number of page faults and improving overall system
performance.
