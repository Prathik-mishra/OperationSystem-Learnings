## 17. Segmentation

Segmentation divides processes into smaller subparts known as modules. The
divided segments need not be placed in contiguous memory. Since there is no
contiguous memory allocation, internal fragmentation does not take place. The
length of the segments of the program and memory is decided by the purpose of
the segment in the user program.

Segmentation came into existence
because of the problems with the paging
technique. In the case of the paging
technique, a function or piece of code is
divided into pages without considering that
the relative parts of code can also get
divided. Hence, for the process in
execution, the CPU must load more than
one page into the frames so that the
complete related code is there for
execution. Paging took more pages for a
process to be loaded into the main
memory.

Hence, segmentation was introduced in which the code is divided into modules
so that related code can be combined in one single block.
