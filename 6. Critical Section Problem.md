## 6. Critical section Problem

The critical section represents a portion of code or a block where a process or
thread accesses a shared resource, such as a variable, file, or database. It's a
section that needs to be executed in an atomic or mutually exclusive manner.
To maintain data integrity and avoid conflicts, only one process or thread should
be allowed to enter the critical section at a time. This ensures that no two
processes interfere with each other and modify shared resources simultaneously,
preventing inconsistencies or incorrect results.
